@ setting up parsers for form 
this stuffs are parsers
app.use(express.json())   // these are parsers
app.use(express.urlencoded({extended:true}));

@ setting up ejs for ejs pages
- install ejs from npm
- settup ejs as view engine
- create views name folder create index.ejs file inside install
- now in app.send replace app.render
- and in req.render('give file name') of index.ejs

app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname , 'public')))
(this line basically joins the current folder path and public folder )
(and for all request static files are get in in this given path)

we want to not change whole route for like routes like
* /profile/amith/
* /profile/sagar/
* /profile/rohit/
* /profile/abhi/

here the dynamic routing come in the game.
)

to make dynamic routes
simply we have to do in '/profile/:names'

to get what is in names use this method req.params this gives object
