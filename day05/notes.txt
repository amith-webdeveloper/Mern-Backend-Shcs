@ Form handling , Sessions and cookies 

overview of the day
(we goona learn how to handle backend process forms and make sure data coming from any frontend lib , fw , or templating engines , we still handle it in the backend)

# install cookie-parser

@ session cookie
(we can store any data in frontend browser and whenever we request in backend the saved frontend data automatically goes to backend)
(the saved data on frontend is called cookie and session is link between data and backend connection)

// made all modifications in day04 script.js file


(the data which send through frontend it is an like blob which is not directly readable so we have to handle to make blob covert to readable)

app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({extended:true}))

these above code convert blob into readable
